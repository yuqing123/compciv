I am thinking about working on a story about Intuitive Surgical’s robotic surgical system.The Da Vinci robotic surgical system allows surgery to be performed using robotic manipulators instead of open surgery. The problem lies in training. Surgeons go through short training sessions with Intuitive. It’s up to themselves and their individual hospital to determine whether they are ready to perform on the real patients. In recent years, there are increasingly medical incidents and product liability lawsuits involving the Da Vinci system.

Data:
FDA MAUDE report that documented incidents involving Intuitive’s surgical systems and instruments. There are four categories - death, injury, malfunction, and other. I am trying to gather the number of incidents over the past 10 years and compare it to the number of da vinci procedures. I am still working with getting the procedures number from Intuitive, which hasn’t replied my email.
I also interviewed the head of robotic surgery committee at El Camino Hospital. He mentioned that the hospital keeps track of the length of individual procedure for every surgeon that performs robotic surgery. For example, if the records show a surgeon uses 10 hours to perform a surgery that usually takes only 3 hours, the hospital will suggest the surgeon to get some practice. I may be able to get the data, but the PR person has asks me to narrow my request down. She also points out that different procedures take different amount of time, and there’s no standard to compare. I still need to figure out what to request and how to make sense of the data.

Next steps:
Continue to contact Intuitive for the number of procedures over year and try to get an interview
Research on companies that also produce robotic surgical system to find out how many incidents they had over year
Figure out what data I want from El Camino Hospital
Talk to robotic surgery injury lawyers for comments.

Minimum story:
Da Vinci robotic surgical system procedures on the rise, and related incidents increases faster/slower. Da Vinci is safer/worse than its competitors.
How surgeons get training to operate Da Vinci system, is it enough/not enough.

Maximum story:
There’s an article online saying that incidents reported by Intuitive Surgical is under reported and the company usually delays the reporting process. I will try to contact the author of the study and verify the study in some way.
