I am thinking about working on a story about Intuitive Surgical’s robotic surgical system.The Da Vinci robotic surgical system allows surgery to be performed using robotic manipulators instead of open surgery. The problem lies in training. Surgeons go through short training sessions with Intuitive. It’s up to themselves and their individual hospital to determine whether they are ready to perform on the real patients. In recent years, there are increasingly medical incidents and product liability lawsuits involving the Da Vinci system.
